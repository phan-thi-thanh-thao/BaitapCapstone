# Tailwind CSS Implementation

## Completed Changes

The project has been successfully converted to use Tailwind CSS:

1. **Configuration files added:**
   - `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration with custom theme settings
   - `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration for Tailwind processing
   - `package.json` - NPM dependencies and build scripts

2. **CSS structure:**
   - `styles/tailwind.css` - Source CSS file with Tailwind directives and custom components
   - `styles/main.css` - Processed output file with all Tailwind utilities

3. **Component design:**
   - Custom components defined using `@layer components` in `tailwind.css`
   - Utility classes used throughout the HTML markup
   - Responsive design maintained with Tailwind's responsive prefixes

4. **Theme customization:**
   - Custom colors defined in `tailwind.config.js`
   - Custom font families configured
   - Container defaults set

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. For development with live reloading:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. For production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Benefits of the Tailwind Implementation

- **Improved development speed** - No need to write custom CSS for most elements
- **Consistent design system** - Using Tailwind's utility classes ensures design consistency
- **Smaller file size** - Tailwind purges unused CSS in production
- **Better maintainability** - Classes directly in HTML make component styling clear
- **Custom components** - Common elements defined as reusable components
